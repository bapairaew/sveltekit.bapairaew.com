An Android app that aims to make exploring Thailand more enjoyable by
introducing missions and challenges. It was built together with three other CS
students using Java for frontend and C# .NET as its backend. We submitted this
for [SAMART Innovation Awards](https://www.samartsia.com/) which we reached
final round with it.
