Developed three different calculator apps for
[Eikon](https://eikon.thomsonreuters.com/index.html) together with three other
teammates. The apps are Floating Rate Note Calculator (FRN), Fixed Rate Bond
Calculator (FRB), and Curve Builder (CB) using
[Nova Angular](/projects/008-nova-angular) They are dealing with displaying big
realtime data from multiple sources while allowing user to override certain
parameters to make their calculation and projection.
