Worked with a psychology student from LSE to develop a simple game to experiment
with how humans interact with AI in different setups. It is an web app providing
a game interface for end-user and a control interface for the psychology
student. The participant will be asked to play a money exchange game with an AI
where they get a commission based on the amount transferred between two of them.
In the later round of the game, the AI will "cheat" the player by not
transferring money back. This is to see how each participant reacted when they
got cheated by non-human.
