Worked closely with an undisclosed client on an experimental project to leverage
on [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns). The
app is a home fitness solution that aims to provide alternative fitness solution
for its users during the lockdown. It features daily home fitness videos,
fitness programs, and fitness challenges whose finishers will be rewarded a
virtual medal. The app is built using React, SWR and Next.js as its frontend and
using Next.js API route and MongoDB as its backend.
