Another over-the-weekend project to try out GraphQL. It shares the same
objective as [World Cup 2014](/projects/009-world-cup-2014) project to new tools
while having with other colleagues but it has different rules. Each player will
be given 100 coins everyday. They can use this is make a prediction on a match
which if it is predicted correctly they will be awarded twice the amount placed.
The application is built using React, Apollo, and Next.js for frontend and
[Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/) for backend.
