Worked with three other fellow course mates to build a Windows Phone app for
[Microsoft's Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com) software
competition. The app aims to fight the literacy problem in thrid world counties
by leveraging on augmented reality. It provides a more intuitive learning
experience with 3D object projection and text translation on top of text books.

The team managed to reach Thailand Microsoft's Imagine Cup Final Round.
