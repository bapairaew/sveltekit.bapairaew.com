Bulding a personal website is something that has always been at the back of my mind. I have always
wanted a space where I can curate and share things that I have done, enjoyed and wanted to share
publicly in the way I wanted.

In a gist, I enjoy building tech stuff, exploring to new places, trying out new food, watching
movies and anime, reading manga and recently I find joy in reading books which admittedly was not so
fun for me so I did only when I had to. Anyway, I could have done so using existing services but I
just do not like that fact that all information is scattered in different places and maintaining it
is a mini nightmare for me.

I like [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) and I see
those as my hobby and having them over different places just does not sit right to me. Maybe, this
is just my software engineering's quirk.

Of course, I do not intend to rebuild every wheels, if there is any service that works well with my
use case I would use it in some way. Maybe hook up the data from there to this website. We will see
about that.

## My old website

All of my old website iterations only focus on one thing - tech stuff that I have built. Due to time
constraint, it was mainly built out of necessity, and that necessity was always applying for a new
job. So it turned out to be a portfolio website with my CV in it with a twist inside to make a
little more stand-out.

This is my latest one, let's just call it version one: you can still visit it here:
https://bapairaew.github.io/ (probably).

This is built with only HTML and CSS or rather [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) and
[Stylus](https://www.stylus.com/). My context back then was that I found the versions before
(version zero and its predecessors) was not so intuitive as there was too many animation inside and
overall aesthetic was off. There was not much thought behind. I do not have the record of it but you
can imagine a typical CV splited into multiple sections. When you scroll into each section there was
always animation accompanying you. Over there, you would have to wait for the animation to finish to
read the content and since there was always something moving, it was too distracting to focus on
reading. It was dubious but it did land me a job.

There was more thought for the one above. I wanted it to be simple and straightforward. I assume
that the main users would be recruiters and hiring managers. I learned that they looked for a
slightly differnt information but both of them looked for the experience and tech stack that I can
use. So those are shown in no-nonsense way, it probably takes you less than half a minute to know
where I worked and what tools I used. Hiring managers would be more interested to know more about
the details of some of the projects so it was not shown only when it was needed through a click.

So that was the general concept. Simple enough. But I need a twist to make it more interesting so I
opted myself trying to build it without any JavaScript and images. I had seen a lot of those in
Codepen and Twitter and I did not think it was too complicated to do so.

I was quite happy with the result but still it was not something that I wanted to build.

## My new website

Now I am in transition to a new job which I have not found yet. So I have some time to properly
build this. Version Two. I looked around in different places -
[Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), tech people's twitter, software house websites, designer and
design firm websites, and also corporate websties. There are a lot out there but mostly they are
either too complicated or too "fancy" to that point that it was not really usable and ultimately
does not suit my use case.

My intention is to build a personal space which covers the following aspects

- **Projects portfolio** to show case my works I have done
- **Blog posts** to write my random thought on random things
- **Photography** to share the photos of the places that I have been
- **Reviews** to record things that I have consumed (food, places, movies, books, etc)

I like [Shu Ding](https://shud.in/) and [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) website for its
simplicity which the later has [his website open-sourced](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io). So I
took some inspiration from these to build my own.

### Writing

So my portfolio and blog posts need to be written alright. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is my choice
for this. It is simple and extensible enough to be able to handle whatever idea I can forsee I would
have thanks to JSX support.

[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) has almost completed out-of-the-box MDX support that I need. The
gap is filled by [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx),
[next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced), and
[next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo). This first one helps me with integration with my
React Framework choice, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). If you have not tried Next.js, go check it
out. It is awesome. The last two helps with metadata and SEO for each post. SEO is not my priority
but the fact that I can save all metadata (like title, published data, tags) in one place is great.

This is how a blog post looks like:

```
---
layout: layouts/AwesomeLayout
title: This is the title
description: This is the description
keywords: tags, more tags, even more tags
publishedTime: 2021-02-13T09:57:59.245Z
---

This is the body.

```

Not sure about you but this looks quite neat to me.

### Photography

Writing/blog is quite straightforward. Everyone is doing it, so, I will have just to follow them.
But how should I approach photos? I do not really want to have a metadata file to pair with every
photos that I have. That would be quite painful to maintain. Thankfully, there is this
[Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) which stores metadata for each photo - camera, lens, date
time, and even location. This is perfect for me since I only want to show when, where and maybe how
this photo is taken. I can just show this data! [exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr) can
help me with extracting the data but unfortunately and exceptedly the location data is saved in
latitude and longitude so I cannot really get the name of the place without turning this data into a
place name somehow.

I could use a location-based API for this.
[Google Place API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview) could do the job but I
do not want to overcomplicate things for now since I am still not sure how to store the place data
properly. Hence, I will just go with manual way.
[macOS Photos](https://www.apple.com/sg/macos/photos/) app actually shows place name from the
coordinate data for you. So, for now, I just copy-paste that into `ImageDescription` field so the
code can just pick up from there. Did not take me that long to do so I am okay with this meanwhile.

## What's next

So I am kind of good with writing and photo bits already so what left is
movies/books/food/places/etc reviews which I planned to use existing service like
[IMDB](https://imdb.com/) to do so people can find me from other places as well. But unfortunately,
their API is quite lacking or not free so I am not sure yet how to go with this yet. Therefore, I
will just let my future self handle it for now.

Another thing, I want to do is upgrade this website aesthetic. While I am very happy with the
minimal and clean look-and-feel but it lacks a certain character in it. I think I might be able to
do better but I do not have any idea how yet. So I will also let this under my future self's care.

## It is open source!

Well, why not, right?

You can have a look at the code here https://github.com/bapairaew/react.bapairaew.com. Any comments
or feedbacks are always appreciated :).

## Update

Actually, I found
[an unpublished iteration of version one](https://codepen.io/bapairaew/embed/EBWBxp?height=751&theme-id=light&default-tab=result).
Plenty of (not really working) animations but not as much as version zero.
