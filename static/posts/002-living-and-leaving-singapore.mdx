## Coming to Singapore

A bit of back story.

It was around end of 2016. I had just finished my backpacking trip in Europe and started looking for
jobs there. After a few months of trying, got rejected by 28 companies, ghosted by another 11, I
finally got an offer from a company in Berlin.

I went back to my hometown waiting for the visa. A few months later, my new company told me that
they could not secure my working visa because I did not fit one of the requirements from their
government.

So, I had to start looking elsewhere. Singapore and Japan was my priority.

I had heard a lot of bad things about working culture in Japan but after a few visits I like the
country in general so that did not stop me.

I did not know much or hear much about Singapore apart from it being the only first world country in
the region and they are very strict society.

I did visit there twice but the experience was quite superficial since I spent the majority of the
time in tourist areas. So how I remembered the country was something along this line:

"Singapore is a very developed country; clean and organised. Everything is expensive. Chicken rice
is not really better than what we have in Thailand. Other food were not really memorable."

Yea, very superficial. I probably needed to do more research if I ever got an offer from there.

And I did.

Thankfully, it did not take long to get a job offer this time.

After that due to laziness, I did not research much about the country apart from checking if I can
live comfortably there with the offered salary and where should I live. I actually made a little
spreadsheet calculating living cost, tax and what kind of saving I am looking at at the end of the
day. What surprised me the most was that the tax here is surpisingly cheap.

My biggest worry back then was actually the language. They speak English but, to be honest, I did
not understand half of what my interviewers were saying because of the accent.

## Living in Singapore

In a gist, I arrived in Singapore on 29 April 2017. My first short stay was at
[Blanc Inn](https://goo.gl/maps/DxQGjiVHkww3RDcB9) then I moved to a longer term place at
[Lakeshore Condominium](https://goo.gl/maps/KjeYmWtKmLMnMoRg7) then I moved around quite a few
times. The places that I stayed at least a few months included;
[The Skywoods](https://goo.gl/maps/HwjPGUTAw4yMHB9NA),
[SkyVille](https://goo.gl/maps/2JTuxumvsyyPz9gr7),
[Commontown at Eng Hoon](https://www.commontown.co/en/house-page/eng-hoon) and
[Spottiswoode 18](https://goo.gl/maps/zsn6e1jecDk8Gqzi8). I would say I had been staying in a quite
variety of places and areas. West, North, Central, shared condo unit, HDB and one bed room condo
unit. Price ranged from 900 to 2,300 SGD a month.

My first meal was 2 SGD Laksa at a random road side-shop along
[Horne Road](https://goo.gl/maps/NsZK9MVzK9vQVg5a9) which I cannot find it in Google Maps anymore.
My last meal was White Bee Hoon at [White Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/3k6KLxtawhBhm9Yg7) at
Jewel. One is underpriced and another is quite overpriced, I would say.

I worked for two different companies in different preriod. The first one was
[Oddle](https://oddle.me/) as a Frontend (Engineer) Lead and the last one was at
[Argile Partners](https://www.argilepartners.com/) as a Vice President.

![Oddle's Tech and Product team](/images/posts/002/oddle.jpeg)

Anyway, I planned to just monologue this whole experience but it became incresingly unreadable as I
wrote so I will just segregate it in different sections to make it easier digested.

### Accomodation

Accomodation cost here is high. Very high. If you are living in a shared condo room without a
bathroom built-in, it would probably cost you around 800 - 1,300 SGD depends mostly on the area and
the condo's facility. The facility usually includes a swimming pool, a gym and a tennis court. I am
still not entirely sure why a tennis court is very common in this kind of living space.

If you prefer a more private life, you might consider a one bed room condo unit. This would cost you
around 2,000 - 3,000 SGD, again, depends on the same criteria above plus the size of the room.
Usually, a room in a shared unit does not differ much in term of size but for one bed room it is
quite a big factor.

There is another kind of room which is semi-private - a dual key unit. It is basically two seperate
rooms with a shared main gate. Usually this type of room is smaller but cheaper than normal one bed
unit.

But if you opted for HDB which is government's housing you would pay a bit less because it does not
come with your typically condo facility. It could cost you around 600 - 1,100 SGD for a room in
shared unit.

There are two terms that you might need to know - common room and master rooom. Common room refers
to a room with no bathroom buit in while master room comes with it and usually bigger in size.

And then there is this co-living space which I think it is not much different than a shared unit in
a private condo but they are more willing to let you stay with a shorter contract at minimum 3
months as oppsed to minimum 1 year for a private condo.

I had stayed in almost all types of these accomodations mentioned above. I would say what matters to
me the most is privacy and the area.

Lakeshore Condominium and The Skywoods are the first two places that I stayed in. Both are quite
similar although they are in very different area. The facility is new, the place is quiet and
peaceful. However, they are quite far from the community. You would have to spend around 30 minutes
to find food or do some grocery shopping. Worse, they are around 40 - 50 minutes from my work which
is a bit too much for me. And I would say staying with stragers was not really fun for me.
Thankfully, I managed to stay with some colleagues in the later so it was much more comfortable.

SkyVille was the first and only HDB that I stayed in. It was in a better area. 30 minutes from work
and 20 minutes from city centre. The lack of condo facility did not bother that much although I kind
of missed the fact that I could jump in the swimming pool after I woke up every weekend.

![A common bedroom at SkyVille](/images/posts/002/skyville.jpeg)

Spottiswoode 18 was the last place that I stayed long term. I would say I like this place the most.
It was a one bed room unit with kitchen built in so I can cook everyday during the great
[Singapore Circuit Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Singapore_circuit_breaker_measures)
preriod. The facility is less good than the other two condominium but it was not that bad. I could
still continue my weekend swimming every week. The place was also very near to my workplace. It was
only 10 minutes walk. Also it was only a couple of stations away from city center.

![Circuit breaker life at Spottiswoode](/images/posts/002/spottiswoode.jpeg)

In between these places, I stayed in co-living spaces as a short term measure while I was
transitioning to a new place.
[Commontown at Eng Hoon](https://www.commontown.co/en/house-page/eng-hoon) and
[Hmlet at Cantonment](https://homes.hmlet.com/cantonment/) were the two places that I stayed. I
would say it did not feel much different from staying at a shared condo unit. But I also have to say
that they were quite good, better than what I thought it would be to be honest. The furniture was
new and the place was clean. The shared area was not bad, actually, I really liked the co-working
space at Hmlet. It was spacious, and reasonably quiet. I would not mind staying there again. I might
have to mention I did not interact much with the housemates there because that is how I am so I
could not comment on this aspect of co-living.

![Hmlet at Cantonment](/images/posts/002/hmlet-at-cantonment.jpeg)

By the way, I did not mention about more luxury options or a landed house because I basically know
nothing much about it.

In term of the area, I prefer central area the most if you can find a more quiet corner there. There
is nothing much in the north or west so after a few weeks you will have to travel to central or east
side to do more things to cure your boredom.

### Work

I worked for two different companies here. My job scope in both of them were fairly different.
However, I think these two companies shared quite a fair bit of similarity.

They valued "hard-working" very highly. It was very common that you would see people working
overtime but maybe not at Japan level, I would assume. From what I read in the internet, this is
quite common working culture in Singapore.

Oddle was quite diverse in term of their employee nationality. I am Thai and my closed colleagues
were from Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, India, and China. Well,
that was almost the whole South East Asia + India and China.

Argile Partners was far less diverse; there were only me and another two colleagues that were not
from Singapore in Singapore office. I guess this difference depends on which industry you are in.
Oddle is kind of a tech company so I guess they are more welcoming for oversea talents.

![Work at Oddle](/images/posts/002/oddle-work.jpeg)

I would love to write more about this but out of respect and confidentiality I may have to keep it
to myself for the time being. Overall, I had positive experience with both, although, the break-up
with the later was rather sour.

### Food

This came as the biggest surprise to me.

Let's talk about the most famous dishes first. Chicken rice is good. I like it. But you can find it
elsewhere as well. I do not think the one in Thailand is much inferior to what they serve in
Singapore. Chilli crab is "not bad" but it is not something I would want to eat often.

The better side of Singapore food is something lie beyond those two dishes. I prefer Hokkien Mee,
Otah Otah, Nasi Lemak, Bak Kut Teh, Biryani, Char Kway Teow, Ma La Hotpot, Ma La Xiang Guo, La Zi
Ji, Shui Zhu Yu, just to name a few, over the two most famous dishes. Okay, not all of these are
"Singaporean" dish but I do not want to argue with authenticity for these. I tried these dishes here
and some considered them as "Singaporean" so let's just say they are for the sake of simplicity.

My favourite dishes are Ma La Xiang Guo, La Zi Ji and Shui Zhu Yu. All of them shares similar spicy
and numbing taste which is the direct translation of the word Ma and La. Funnily enough, I did not
like this taste the first time I tried it. It was too spicy and numbing which made you unable to
taste anything else in the dish. After a while, my taste bud adjusted and I came to love this
flavour.

Ma La Xiang Guo offers you variety in ingredients. Basically you can pick whatever you like and the
cook will stir them with Ma La chilli oil for you. You can experience a lot of different textures
and other underlying tastes mixed together with Ma La which enhance those taste greatly. I never
liked
[lotus root](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/06/seriously-asian-stir-fried-lotus-root-with-vegetables-daikon-miso-soup-recipe.html)
or okra but they are so good with Ma La. Now, they are a must have in my Ma La dishes.

![Ma La Xiang Guo](/images/posts/002/ma-la-xiang-guo.jpeg)

La Zi Ji is basically fried chicken with Ma La taste. You get the crunchiness and the juicy chicken
meat taste which fits very well with the numbing sensation.

![La Zi Ji](/images/posts/002/la-zi-ji.jpeg)

Shui Zhu Yu is basically Ma La Hotpot with grilled fish. The soup tends to have a thinner taste than
the typically Ma La soup. So you can actually sip it... if your heat tolerance is high.

![Shui Zhu Yu](/images/posts/002/shui-zhu-yu.jpeg)

Another thing I want to mention is coffee. To be honest, I did not drink much coffee until I come
here. It slowly became essential to my life. At first, I tried local
[Kopi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_(drink)>). The taste was okay or I would say it was what
you would expect from the 1 SGD price point. But I was not sure what's inside there messed up with
my digestive system every time I drank it so I had to stop drinking it after a while.

Next, I tried the more expensive espresso-based option. The price was at around 6 SGD per cup which
did not make much sense to me to pay that much every day. Until I found a more affordable and very
good taste at [Nylon](https://www.nyloncoffee.sg/). It is my favorite cup of coffee so far. I think
at some point I started going there every day to get a cup of coffee.

![Coffee at Nylon](/images/posts/002/nylon.jpeg)

### Leisure time

I asked one of my Singaporean colleagues about what to do during weekends. The answer was "Nothing,
Singapore is very boring".

Well, after living here for a few years, I kind of agree with that. To be fair, Singapore is a small
country in terms of size. So they cannot offer a wide variety of activities due to this limitation.
Here you could, chill on a beach at Sentosa or enjoy USS, "hike" at Macritchie, cafe hopping around
Bugis and Tanjong Pagar, bike along the east coast, explore Night Safari or Singapore Zoo, walk
around Garden by the Bay or Botanic Garden, explore some local food from various
[Hawker centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre) or enjoy nightlife around central
area. And that is about it. It is not much different from other major cities. But other cities have
the advantage that they are usually more well connected with more exotic places that could offer a
wider range of activities. For example, you can easily go to one of many islands in Thailand from
Bangkok without much issue or you can take some historic trip to Stratford-Upon-Avon from London
over a weekend.

![Bike at Marina Bay](/images/posts/002/marina.jpeg)

But anyway, you could also save up and just fly out overseas to enjoy other activities from
Singapore as well. So I would not say it is all that bad.

### Finance

I already mentioned quite a fair bit about accommodation costs earlier. I think in general it would
take around 1/4 to 1/2 of your salary depends on how high is the accommodation on your list. The
rest you would spend on transportation, food , and leisure time activities.

Public transportation here is cheap. It only cost around 1 - 2 SGD per trip for either SMRT or bus.
It is getting more expensive if you go for a more private option. Taxi will cost you 6 SGD minimum
but, realistically, you generally spend 15 - 25 SGD per trip. Unless, you call for a taxi during
peak hours, late night, rain, it could hike up to 40 - 50 SGD easily.

For leisure time, there are quite a few "free" activities you can do. For example, walk in the park,
hiking, and biking. Cafe hopping For the Gram can get expensive. A cup of coffee costs you around 6
SGD and a brunch dish cost you more than 20 SGD. For a more fancy dinner, it could easily cost you
more than 100 SGD per person. On a night out, you would spend around 10 SGD per glass of beer, 25
SGD for a cocktail, or 20 SGD per glass of wine depends on the quality of it, of course. So if you
are not careful with this you can easily break your savings in no time.

## Leaving Singapore

Well, actually, it is nothing complicated.

First, I think my current job is not a good fit for me and I think not being able to go anywhere and
take a break really take toll on my mental health so I decided to leave my current job and go back
to my home country to take a short break.

I plan to come back here for sure. Maybe for another job to get a PR and then citizenship here or
maybe just a short visit.

We shall see what the future holds.
